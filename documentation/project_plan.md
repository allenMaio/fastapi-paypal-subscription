| User Story                                                                                                                            | Story Point | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| As an engineer, I need to design a recurring payment logic that allows variable amounts, supporting flexible usage-based billing for clients. | 5          | - Dynamically calculates payment amounts based on input parameters (usage/orders) <br/>- Simulation tests can successfully charge payments |
| As an engineer, I need to thoroughly test and validate this dynamic payment flow to ensure different billing cycles and amounts function correctly. | 5          | - Passes multiple scenario tests (various billing cycles, different amounts) <br/>- PayPal returns accurate payment results          |
| As an engineer, I need to record detailed information about each payment (amount, date, Subscription ID) in a database or file, allowing future analysis and tracking.        | 3          | - Every completed payment generates a clear payment record <br/>- Records can be queried by Subscription ID for payment history      |

## **Sprint 4: Callback API Development & Integration**

| User Story                                                                                                                                                                      | Story Point | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| As an engineer, I need to develop and enable a Callback API (Webhook Endpoint) to receive PayPal subscription notifications (e.g., cancellation, expiration) and automatically update subscription status. | 5          | - Receives PayPal Webhook notifications successfully <br/>- Subscription status is automatically updated based on notifications |
| As an engineer, I need to verify the signature and source of Webhook callbacks to ensure that only official PayPal notifications can change the system status.                  | 5          | - Can validate and reject suspicious notifications <br/>- System logs show the result of notification verification      |
| As an engineer, I need to log all Webhook calls and how the system processes them, making subsequent debugging or tracing easier.                                               | 3          | - Every received Webhook is recorded (time, event, update result) <br/>- Exceptional cases and test scenarios are handled correctly |

## **Why This Order?**

1. **Environment & Basics (Sprint 1)**  
   - First, establish a solid development environment (Python + FastAPI) and security foundation (SSL), plus Docker containerization to keep development and future deployment consistent.

2. **Core Payment API Integration (Sprint 2)**  
   - Next, integrate the PayPal API and implement the basic subscription feature. Confirming the ability to connect and subscribe is key.

3. **Complex Billing Logic (Sprint 3)**  
   - After confirming the basic subscription workflow, design the recurring variable payment logic and record-keeping. This involves more business logic and requires more time to verify.

4. **Callback & Automated Notifications (Sprint 4)**  
   - Introduce the Webhook (Callback API) to automatically update subscription status upon payments or cancellations. Security verification and logging must be considered.

5. **Final Integration & Deployment (Sprint 5)**  
   - Conduct full integration tests and finalize the deployment, including documentation so new team members can onboard quickly.

This plan is written from the engineer’s perspective (Developer Tasks) and takes into account both the required project features and the technical implementation sequence.
